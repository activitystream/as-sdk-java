Currently this SDK allows for convenient way to construct events to send to Activity Stream. It is still at an early stage but expected to mature quickly since it is used internally at Activity Stream too.

If you want to get the latest release, please check the ["release" tab in github](https://github.com/activitystream/as-sdk-java/releases). It will be available as maven package soon.
